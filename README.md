Project: Building a simulation environment for dough manipulation

Progress Made: I was able to setup the simulation for CPU. My simulation builds the scene and adds the robot, which falls immediately after starting.

Challenges: The main challenge I encountered was getting the simulation to display on my computer. I watched a YouTube tutorial that showed me how to get Genesis running correctly on my Mac. After using this starter code, I was able to see the simulation fine.

Project Outline: I had some unforeseen circumstances this weekend and didn’t have access to WiFi. These are the next steps I would have taken had I had more time.

1.	Initialize the joint velocities so that the robot doesn’t fall down immediately
2.	Figure out how to move the robot in a pre-planned manner
3.	Add a table and dough to the simulation
4.	Place the robot and dough on the table with good proximity
5.	Figure out how to make the robot pick up the dough
6.	Develop a series of predefined manipulation actions
7.	Record the simulation
